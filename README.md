You will really quickly see some GitHub products in this step: assign yourself an issue, create a branch, edit it, create and PR and merge it

Collaborative development model is by default the [shared repository model](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models). This setup can be changed at Organization level by the Organization owner.
